- add api call to select max number of tracks in a playlist instead of hardcoding it.
- add ability to also check temp as a clear day is not always hot etc.
- add min and max temps for the day
- improve accuracy by taking into account the entire day. not just the current hour. (use daily from api for the what you will need)
use data.daily.icon to change the pre set desc and image for what you will need.
- change out the widget to suit the page theme (minimilistic/grey)
